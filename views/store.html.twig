<!-- -- 1. Want to display the name of the store clicked on from the index page at the top of this page.

-- 2. Want to display the brands that are carried within that store on this page.

-- 3.  Show pictures of the brand of shoes that carried by this store on this page.

NOTE:  The above is not displaying anything right now, but the idea *seems* right.
